Hello World! (pun intended)

My name is Jermaine Tucker, and I am a beginner in the web development world. I got my degree in English-Professional Writing because writing was my weakness and also because I wanted to gain the skillset that writing had to offer. In gainin my writing skillset, I now intend to enter the web development/software development/ cybersecurity world. 

So far, I have taking a DIY approach to get started off. I have taught myself HTML and CSS although I still need refinement in them. Now, I am learning JavaScript and it is hard so far, but that is because I am not use to it. I just have to take a systematic approach to it and I will get it. As a way to learn javascript and jquery. I am using the book made by jon duckett, sololearn, and W3 school. 

The next languages that I want to conquer after JavaScript are Java, Python, PHP, and SQL. After I learn these languages, I plan to use java to develop android apps and maybe games; I plan to use php, sql, and python for wordpress developer; I plan to use HTML to develop or code a website if necessary--I think I will explore other potential uses for HTML and CSS.
